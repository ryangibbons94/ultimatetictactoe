Yo dawg we heard you like tic tac toe, so we put tic tac toe inside of tic tac toe.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OOP

## Optimizations
Styles need to be adjusted. There is a bug where if a user selects a square that is taken already, it will switch to that cooresponding square on the big board. I need to adjust the tie game conditions for both the big board and small boards.

## Challenges Faced/Lessons Learned:

Coming Soon.
